This application is designed to recommend books based on user preferences. It provides a simple interface for users to input their favorite genres or recent reads and generates personalized book suggestions. The system utilizes a basic recommendation model powered by Python, ensuring tailored recommendations that enhance the user's reading experience.

**Technologies and Tools**

**Python (Backend and Recommendation Model):**  
- **Usage:** Implement the recommendation system's logic and process data.  
- **Key libraries:**  
  - `pandas`: To manipulate and analyze book and user data.  
  - `scikit-learn`: For basic recommendation algorithms (e.g., collaborative filtering).  
  - `Flask` or `FastAPI`: To create an API for communication between the frontend and backend.  

**HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Frontend):**  
- **Usage:** Create a basic user interface for interactions (e.g., entering preferences, viewing recommendations).  
- **Additional framework:**  
  - Bootstrap: For a more visually appealing and responsive design.  

**SQLite (Database):**  
- **Usage:** Store book data and user interactions.  
- **Advantages:** Lightweight, easy to set up, and ideal for small projects.  

**GitHub Codespaces:**  
- **Usage:** Serves as the integrated development environment where everything is centralized.  

**GitHub Copilot (Optional):**  
- **Usage:** To generate code snippets and accelerate development.  

**Integration Tools:**  
- **Fetch API or Axios (Frontend):** Used to send HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend (e.g., to submit user preferences or fetch recommendations).

**How the Technologies Connect**

**Frontend (HTML/JS):**  
- The interface collects user input (e.g., favorite genres or the last book read).  
- Sends this information to the backend via an HTTP request (POST or GET) using JavaScript.  

**Backend (Python with Flask or FastAPI):**  
- Receives the request from the frontend.  
- Processes user data using the recommendation model (e.g., collaborative or content-based filtering algorithm).  
- Queries the SQLite database to find relevant books.  
- Responds to the frontend with recommendations.  

**Database (SQLite):**  
- Contains an initial dataset of books (titles, authors, genres, ratings, etc.).  
- Stores user data if a login or personalization system is implemented.  

**Recommendation Model (Python):**  
- Processes data to generate personalized recommendations.  
- Uses libraries such as `scikit-learn` to implement basic recommendation algorithms.
